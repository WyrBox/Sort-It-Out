# Sort It Out
## Introduction
This repository is aimed at the development/optimisation of various sorting algorithms in various programming languages.

Ideally, this repository will contain novel and original implementations that can develop existing and new algorithms for a range of applications.

## During Development
### Folder and File Naming
- Only use standard alphanumeric characters, alongside the 3 portable special characters (".", "-", "_")
- Begin folders and files with numbers (when chronological order is preferred), and name them using this pattern:
    - "##_Name-of-Folder-or-File", where ## is a two digit number (e.g. "01", "04", "45"...)
- When claiming a folder or file for yourself, use your designated 3-character initials (first letter of first name, and first two letters of surname):
    - E.g. Jack Smith = JSM, Eve Smith = ESM
    - A "claimed" folder or file will therefore look like:
        - "03_Std-Implementation_JSM"
